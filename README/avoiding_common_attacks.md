# Avoiding Common Attacks
This document describes the measures that have taken to ensure that the contracts are not susceptible to common attacks.

## No Looping
gas limit attacks

## Contract size
limited attack vector


## Testing  
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phzietsman/proof-o-existence.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phzietsman/proof-o-existence)    

Good test coverage ensures the contract does not fall prey to simple code bugs or logic issues, that is clear from the code, but easy to catch in testing.

Test coverage is very good and the repository was hooked up with TravisCI to run 
the tests everytime the code sis commited. This has the benfit that the code gets tested in a clean environment very often.
